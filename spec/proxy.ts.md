## proxy.ts

The `proxy.ts` file is located in the `src` folder and is used to configure the proxy middleware for the application.

### Code

```typescript
import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'http-proxy-middleware';
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

const proxy = createProxyMiddleware({
  target: 'http://api.example.com',
  changeOrigin: true,
  pathRewrite: {
    '^/api': '',
  },
});

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  return proxy(req, res);
}
```

### Explanation

The `proxy.ts` file exports a default function that acts as a request handler for the Next.js API routes. It uses the `createProxyMiddleware` function from the `http-proxy-middleware` package to configure a proxy for the API requests.

The `createProxyMiddleware` function takes an options object as its parameter. In this case, the options object specifies the following properties:

- `target`: The target URL to proxy the requests to. In this example, it is set to `http://api.example.com`.
- `changeOrigin`: A boolean value indicating whether the `Origin` header should be changed to the target URL. It is set to `true` in this example.
- `pathRewrite`: An object that allows rewriting the path of the incoming request. In this example, it is used to remove the `/api` prefix from the request path.

The exported function acts as a request handler for the Next.js API routes. It receives the `req` (NextApiRequest) and `res` (NextApiResponse) objects as parameters and passes them to the `proxy` middleware created by `createProxyMiddleware`.

This configuration allows the application to proxy API requests to the specified target URL while removing the `/api` prefix from the request path.
