# Global Declarations

The `global.d.ts` file contains global type declarations that can be used throughout the project. It provides a way to define custom types and interfaces that are accessible from any file in the project.

## Updated Declarations

### Custom Types

```typescript
declare module 'my-module' {
  export function myFunction(): void;
  export const myVariable: string;
}
```

The `my-module` module is declared with two exports: `myFunction` and `myVariable`. These can be imported and used in other files.

### Custom Interfaces

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

interface Post {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  content: string;
}
```

The `User` and `Post` interfaces are defined with specific properties. These interfaces can be used to define the shape of objects in the project.

### Global Variables

```typescript
declare const API_URL: string;
declare const MAX_RESULTS: number;
```

The `API_URL` and `MAX_RESULTS` variables are declared as global constants. These can be accessed and used throughout the project.

### Global Functions

```typescript
declare function log(message: string): void;
declare function calculateSum(a: number, b: number): number;
```

The `log` and `calculateSum` functions are declared as global functions. These can be called and used from any file in the project.

## Additional Notes

- The `global.d.ts` file should only contain global type declarations and should not include any implementation code.
- It is recommended to use specific naming conventions for custom types and interfaces to avoid naming conflicts with existing types and interfaces.
- Global variables and functions should be used sparingly and only when necessary. It is generally recommended to encapsulate variables and functions within modules or classes to avoid polluting the global namespace.
