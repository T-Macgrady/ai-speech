## Global Declarations

The `next-env.d.ts` file includes global declarations for the Next.js environment. It provides type definitions for global objects and functions that are available in the Next.js runtime.

```typescript
/// <reference types="next" />
/// <reference types="next/types/global" />
/// <reference types="next/image-types/global" />
```

The `/// <reference types="next" />` directive references the type definitions for the Next.js framework itself.

The `/// <reference types="next/types/global" />` directive references the type definitions for global Next.js types, such as `NextPage` and `GetServerSideProps`.

The `/// <reference types="next/image-types/global" />` directive references the type definitions for the Next.js Image component.

These global declarations allow you to use Next.js-specific types and features in your TypeScript code.

Note: This file is automatically generated by Next.js and should not be modified manually.
