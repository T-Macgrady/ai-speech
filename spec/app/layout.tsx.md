## Explanation

The `Layout` component is a functional component that represents the overall layout of the application. It renders a container div with a heading, a React icon, and a React player component.

The `ReactIcon` component is imported from the `react-icons` module and is used to display an icon from the AiOutlineHome icon pack.

The `ReactPlayer` component is imported from the `react-player` module and is used to embed and play a YouTube video with the specified URL.

## Usage

To use the `Layout` component in your application, import it and render it as a child component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Layout from './app/layout';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Layout />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Props

The `Layout` component does not accept any props.

## Styling

The styling for the `Layout` component can be customized using CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution like Tailwind CSS. The container div has a class name of "container" which can be targeted for styling.

Example CSS:

```css
.container {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Example Tailwind CSS:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Layout from './app/layout';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-200 p-4">
      <Layout />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In the above example, the container div has a gray background color and 4 units of padding applied.
