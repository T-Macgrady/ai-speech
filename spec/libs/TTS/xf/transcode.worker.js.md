# `libs/TTS/xf/transcode.worker.js` Specification

## Description

This file contains the implementation of the `transcode.worker.js` worker script used in the `libs/TTS/xf` module. The worker script is responsible for performing audio transcoding operations using the XF library.

## Dependencies

This file has the following dependencies:

- `libs/TTS/xf/xf.js`

## Functions

### `transcodeAudio`

```javascript
function transcodeAudio(inputFile, outputFile, format) {
  // Implementation details
}
```

This function is used to transcode audio from one format to another. It takes three parameters:

- `inputFile` (string): The path to the input audio file.
- `outputFile` (string): The path to the output audio file.
- `format` (string): The desired output format for the transcoded audio.

The function performs the transcoding operation using the XF library and saves the transcoded audio to the specified output file.

## Usage

To use the `transcodeAudio` function, import it from the `transcode.worker.js` script and call it with the appropriate parameters:

```javascript
import { transcodeAudio } from 'libs/TTS/xf/transcode.worker.js';

const inputFile = '/path/to/input/audio.wav';
const outputFile = '/path/to/output/audio.mp3';
const format = 'mp3';

transcodeAudio(inputFile, outputFile, format);
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/input/audio.wav` with the actual path to the input audio file, `/path/to/output/audio.mp3` with the desired path for the output audio file, and `'mp3'` with the desired output format.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `transcodeAudio` function to transcode an audio file from WAV to MP3:

```javascript
import { transcodeAudio } from 'libs/TTS/xf/transcode.worker.js';

const inputFile = '/path/to/input/audio.wav';
const outputFile = '/path/to/output/audio.mp3';
const format = 'mp3';

transcodeAudio(inputFile, outputFile, format);
```

In this example, the `transcodeAudio` function is used to transcode the audio file located at `/path/to/input/audio.wav` to MP3 format and save the transcoded audio to `/path/to/output/audio.mp3`.
