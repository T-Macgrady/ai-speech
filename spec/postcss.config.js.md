# postcss.config.js

The `postcss.config.js` file is used to configure PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. This file specifies the plugins and their options that should be used when processing CSS files.

Here is the updated content for the `postcss.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

In the updated configuration, we have included two plugins: `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer`. The `tailwindcss` plugin is responsible for processing Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, while the `autoprefixer` plugin adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

Please make sure to install the required npm module `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` to use these plugins.
